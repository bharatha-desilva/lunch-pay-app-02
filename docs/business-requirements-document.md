## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
LunchPay is an expense-splitting web application designed to help friends and groups track shared expenses, split costs fairly, and settle debts efficiently. The application specifically focuses on lunch expenses and group dining scenarios, providing a streamlined solution for common financial coordination challenges among friends, colleagues, and social groups.

### 1.2 Business Case
Groups frequently struggle with fairly splitting shared expenses, leading to:
