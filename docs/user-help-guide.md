Your Balances - Office Lunch Squad
================================

Overall: You are owed $12.50

Individual Balances:
👤 Sarah    owes you    $4.25
👤 Mike     owes you    $8.25
👤 Alex     you owe     $0.00

[Settle Up] [View History]
```

**Understanding the Numbers:**
- **Green amounts**: Money owed to you
- **Red amounts**: Money you owe others
- **$0.00**: You're even with this person

**Calculation Example:**
If you paid $25.50 for lunch with Sarah and Mike:
- Total expense: $25.50
- Split 3 ways: $8.50 each
- You paid: $25.50
- You owe: $8.50
- **You are owed: $25.50 - $8.50 = $17.00**

### 5. Advanced Expense Splitting

Sometimes expenses aren't split equally. LunchPay offers flexible splitting options.

#### Unequal Split by Amount

**When to Use:** When people ordered different amounts or consumed different quantities.

**Steps:**
1. When adding an expense, change **Split Type** to **"Custom Amounts"**
2. Enter specific amounts for each participant:

**📸 Custom Split Example:**
```
Split Type: [💰 Custom Amounts ▼]

Who participated?
☑️ Sarah    [$12.00]  (had the steak)
☑️ Mike     [$8.50 ]  (had sandwich)
☑️ You      [$5.00 ]  (just had appetizer)

Total: $25.50 ✅
```

3. Ensure amounts add up to total expense
4. Click **"Add Expense"**

#### Percentage Split

**When to Use:** When you want to split based on income, usage, or preference.

**Steps:**
1. Change **Split Type** to **"Percentage Split"**
2. Enter percentages that total 100%:

**📸 Percentage Split Example:**
```
Split Type: [📊 Percentage Split ▼]

Who participated?
☑️ Sarah    [40%] ($10.20)
☑️ Mike     [35%] ($8.93 )
☑️ You      [25%] ($6.37 )

Total: 100% = $25.50 ✅
```

> **⚠️ Important:** Custom splits must add up exactly to the total expense amount.

### 6. Settling Debts

When someone pays you back, record it to keep balances accurate.

**Steps:**
1. From your balance page, click **"Settle Up"** next to the person's name
2. Enter settlement details:

**📸 Settlement Form:**
```
Record Settlement
-----------------
From: [Mike ▼]
To: [You ▼]
Amount: [$8.25]
Date: [📅 Today ▼]
Note: [Venmo payment] (optional)

[Record Settlement] [Cancel]
```

## Tips for Success

### 💡 Best Practices

#### For Group Admins:
- **Set clear expectations** about expense tracking
- **Add expenses promptly** while details are fresh
- **Use descriptive names** (e.g., "Lunch at Mario's" not just "Food")
- **Check balances regularly** to catch errors early

#### For All Users:
- **Take photos of receipts** for reference
- **Communicate settlements** outside the app (text, Venmo, etc.)
- **Review monthly balances** to settle up regularly
- **Use categories consistently** for better tracking

#### Smart Settlement Strategy:
1. **Settle monthly** rather than after each expense
2. **Round to convenient amounts** (e.g., $20 instead of $19.73)
3. **Use digital payment apps** (Venmo, Zelle) for convenience
4. **Keep settlement notes** for your records
