## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Architecture
```typescript

interface AuthToken {
  token: string;
  expiresAt: number;
  user: UserProfile;
}

// Protected Route Implementation
<ProtectedRoute>
  <DashboardPage />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### API Integration

- **Groups Service**: CRUD operations for group management
- **Error Handling**: Standardized API error response handling
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all async operations

### Component Structure Added
```
src/components/
├── auth/
│   ├── LoginForm.tsx        # User login with validation
│   ├── RegisterForm.tsx     # User registration form
│   ├── ProtectedRoute.tsx   # Route protection wrapper
│   └── PublicRoute.tsx      # Guest-only routes
├── groups/

## 🔄 API Endpoints Implemented

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication with JWT token response
- `POST /auth/logout` - Session termination
- `POST /users` - User registration with validation

### Group Management Endpoints
- `GET /groups` - List user's groups with member information
- `POST /groups` - Create new group with admin assignment
- `GET /groups/{group_id}` - Get group details with members
- `POST /groups/{group_id}/members` - Add members to group

---

## 🚧 Breaking Changes

### Authentication Required
- **Route Access**: All main application routes now require authentication
- **API Calls**: Authentication token required for protected endpoints
- **State Management**: AuthContext now mandatory for user state access

### Component Props Changes
```typescript
// New required props for protected components
interface ProtectedComponentProps {
  user: UserProfile;  // Now required from AuthContext
}
```

---

## 📋 Migration Notes

### Updating from v0.1.0
1. **Authentication Setup**: Users must register/login to access application
2. **Environment Variables**: Add authentication-related environment variables:
   ```env
   VITE_JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
   VITE_TOKEN_EXPIRY=86400000  # 24 hours in milliseconds
   ```
3. **API Integration**: Backend must implement authentication endpoints
4. **State Access**: Update components to use AuthContext for user data

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Authentication
- **Token Refresh**: Manual token refresh required (automatic refresh pending)
- **Remember Me**: Session persistence relies on localStorage only
- **Password Reset**: Password recovery functionality not yet implemented

### Group Management
- **Member Removal**: Remove member functionality structure ready but not implemented
- **Group Settings**: Advanced group configuration options pending
- **Invitation System**: Simplified member addition (email invitations pending)

### UI/UX
- **Loading States**: Some operations may not show loading indicators
- **Error Messages**: Generic error messages may need more specificity
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design tested but may need fine-tuning

## 🚀 Upgrade Steps

### From v0.1.0 to v0.2.0

1. **Pull Latest Changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   ```

2. **Update Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   VITE_JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_development_secret
   ```

3. **Database Setup** (Backend Required):
   - Users table with email, password_hash, name, created_at
   - Groups table with name, description, admin_id, created_at
   - Group_members table with group_id, user_id, joined_at

4. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   # Test registration and login functionality
   ```
