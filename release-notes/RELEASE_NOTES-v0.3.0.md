## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Expense Splitting Engine
```typescript
// Equal Splitting Logic
const calculateEqualSplit = (amount: number, participants: User[]) => {
  const splitAmount = amount / participants.length;
  return participants.map(user => ({
    userId: user.id,
    amount: Number(splitAmount.toFixed(2))
  }));
};

// Unequal Splitting Validation
const validateUnequalSplit = (totalAmount: number, splits: Split[]) => {
  const splitTotal = splits.reduce((sum, split) => sum + split.amount, 0);
  return Math.abs(splitTotal - totalAmount) < 0.01; // Allow for rounding
};
```

### Balance Calculation System
```typescript
// Real-time Balance Updates
interface UserBalance {
  userId: string;
  totalPaid: number;
  totalOwed: number;
  netBalance: number; // positive = owed to user, negative = user owes
}

const calculateGroupBalances = (expenses: Expense[], settlements: Settlement[]) => {
  // Complex balance calculation logic
  // Accounts for all expenses and settlements
  // Returns real-time balance state
};
```

### Settlement Validation
```typescript
// Settlement Amount Validation
const validateSettlement = (
  fromUserId: string,
  toUserId: string,
  amount: number,
  currentBalances: UserBalance[]
) => {
  const debt = getCurrentDebt(fromUserId, toUserId, currentBalances);
  return amount > 0 && amount <= debt;
};
```

   ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN category VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Other';
   ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN split_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'equal';
   
   -- Create settlements table
   CREATE TABLE settlements (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
     from_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     to_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
     description TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );

     percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
     PRIMARY KEY (expense_id, user_id)
   );
   ```

### Balance Calculations
- **Real-Time Updates**: Balance updates may have slight delay in large groups
- **Settlement Validation**: Edge cases with circular debts not fully handled
- **History Performance**: Balance history may be slow with >1000 transactions

### UI/UX
- **Split Preview**: Complex splits may not display clearly on mobile
- **Settlement Flow**: Multi-step settlement process may be confusing
- **Error Recovery**: Some validation errors require page refresh
