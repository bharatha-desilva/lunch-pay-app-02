## 🎯 **How to Use These Rules**

### **For Complete MVP Development**

1. Start with **MVP Coding Prompt** for core application
2. Add **Testing Suite Prompt** for comprehensive testing
3. Implement **Pre-Push Quality Gate Prompt** for quality enforcement

### **For Specific Tasks**

- **New Feature**: Use MVP Coding Prompt + Testing Suite Prompt
- **Testing Implementation**: Use Testing Suite Prompt only
- **Quality Enforcement**: Use Pre-Push Quality Gate Prompt only
- **Code Review**: Use Pre-Push Quality Gate Prompt for validation

### **Integration Points**

- All prompts are designed to work together
- Shared technical standards and requirements
- Consistent output formats and documentation
- Complementary quality assurance approaches

## 🔧 **Technical Standards**

### **Common Requirements Across All Prompts**

- **Node.js**: 18.18.0+ compatibility (22.x for quality gates)
- **React**: 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- **Build Tools**: Vite for fast development and builds
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + E2E tools
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated quality checks

### **Output Format Consistency**

- **Repository-style Markdown** responses
- **Per-file code blocks** for critical files
- **Comprehensive documentation** for each area
- **CI/CD integration** examples and workflows

## 🚀 **Best Practices**

### **1. Use the Right Prompt for the Job**

- Don't use MVP Coding Prompt for testing-only tasks
- Don't use Quality Gate Prompt for new development
- Combine prompts appropriately for comprehensive solutions

### **2. Follow the Sequential Order**

- Quality gates must run in specified order
- Testing should be implemented before quality gates
- MVP development should include testing from the start

### **3. Maintain Consistency**

- Use the same technical standards across all areas
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Implement consistent error handling patterns

### **4. Document Everything**

- Each prompt requires comprehensive documentation
- Include examples and implementation patterns
- Provide troubleshooting and troubleshooting guidance
